# Connect Four - Python Terminal Game

Welcome to a simple command-line version of **Connect Four**, where you (🔵) play against the computer (🔴)! Drop your token into the correct space and try to connect four before your opponent does.

## 🎮 How to Play

- The game board is 6 rows by 7 columns.
- You take turns with the computer.
- Input your move by typing a column letter (A-G) followed by a row number (0-5), like `A3`.
- Your token will only drop if it's supported by the bottom of the board or another token below.
- The game ends when either player gets 4 in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## 🧠 Example Input
Choose a space: C2
This places your chip in column C and row 2 (if the space below is valid).

## ▶️ Run the Game
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
